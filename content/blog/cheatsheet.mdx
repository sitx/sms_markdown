## International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships

1. Regulations for the prevention of pollution **by oil**
2. Regulation for the prevention of pollution **by noxious liquid substances in
   bulk**
3. Regulation for the prevention of pollution **by harmful substances carried by
   sea in packaged form**
4. Regulation for the prevention of the pollution **by sewage from ships**
5. Regulation for thr prevention of the pollution by **garbage from ships**
6. Regulation for the prevention of **air pollution from ships**

## IMSBC code

1. General requirements for carrying solid bulk cargoes Accepting cargoes for
   shipment Loading
   - Information required from the shipper
   - Checking the cargo schedule
   - Inspecting and preparing cargo spaces
   - Accepting cargoes not listed in the IMSBC Code
   - Distribution and stability
   - Loading Plan
2. The Code’s three cargo groups

   - Group **A** – cargoes which may liquefy if shipped at a moisture content
     exceeding their **Transportable Moisture Limit** (**TML**)
     - **AMC** - actual moisture content
   - Group **B** – cargoes which possess a chemical hazard which could give rise
     to
     - Materials hazardous only in bulk (**MHB**)
     - Dangerous goods in solid form in bulk
     - Combustible solids
     - Self-heating solids
     - Solids that evolve into flammable gas when wet
     - Solids that evolve toxic gas when wet
     - Toxic solids
     - Corrosive solids
   - Group **C** – cargoes which are neither liable to liquefy (Group A) nor a
     dangerous situation on a ship. possess chemical hazards (Group B). Cargoes
     in this group can still be hazardous.

3. Other hazards associated with carrying solid bulk cargoes

   - Entering enclosed spaces
   - Pesticides (Fumigants)

4. Cargo residues deemed harmful to the marine environment (**HME**)
5. Checklist and flowchart for accepting and loading solid bulk cargoes

- Appendix 1 IMO regulations and guidance relating to the transport of solid
  bulk cargoes

- Appendix 2 The Code section by section

## Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea

(**COLREG**), 1972 Конвенция о Международных правилах предупреждения
столкновений судов в море (МППСС), 1972

## International Convention on Load Lines (LL), 1966

Международная конвенция о грузовой марке (КГМ), 1966

## Grain code

SOLAS ch 6 / res. msc.23(59)

### Requirements

1. **Angle of heel** due to assumed shifring of GRAIN not to be more than
   **12°** or deck edge immersion angle, whichever is less

2. RESIDUAL AREA between **heeling arm curve** and **GZ curve** shall be atleast
   **0.0075 m \* rad**

3. Initial GM to be atleast **0.30 m**

4. VSL to be upright before depature (no list b4 depature)

Grain have Low **AOR** - angle of repose (about 12-15°)

![angle of repose](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Angleofrepose.png/420px-Angleofrepose.png)

### Assumed shift

- compartment **PARTLY FILLED** - grain can shift from initial surface up to
  **25°**
- compartment **FULLY FILLED** - grain can shift from initial surface up to
  **15°**

```
SF = Vol/Mass = m3/t

Moment = mass / distance

VHM = Moment / SF
```

**SF** - Stowage factor / how much space occupay 1 tonna of cargo

**VHM** - Volumetric Heeling Moment

There are factors for VHM, implemented due to Grain shift not only horizontaly
but also verticaly:

- Fully Trimmed CC = 1.06
- Fully Untrimmed = 1
- Partly loaded & Trimmed = 1.12

```

 Righting Moment = GZ * D

```

**GZ** - Righting lever

**D** - displacement

```
λ₀ = Heeling lever(angle of shift 0°) = VHM / (SF \* D) m

COS 40° = 0.766044 ~> 0.8

λ₄₀ = Heeling lever(angle of shift 40°) = λ₀ * 0.8
```
