## International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships

1. Regulations for the prevention of pollution **by oil**
2. Regulation for the prevention of pollution **by noxious liquid substances in
   bulk**
3. Regulation for the prevention of pollution **by harmful substances carried by
   sea in packaged form**
4. Regulation for the prevention of the pollution **by sewage from ships**
5. Regulation for thr prevention of the pollution by **garbage from ships**
6. Regulation for the prevention of **air pollution from ships**

## IMSBC code

1. General requirements for carrying solid bulk cargoes Accepting cargoes for
   shipment Loading
   - Information required from the shipper
   - Checking the cargo schedule
   - Inspecting and preparing cargo spaces
   - Accepting cargoes not listed in the IMSBC Code
   - Distribution and stability
   - Loading Plan
2. The Code’s three cargo groups

   - Group **A** – cargoes which may liquefy if shipped at a moisture content
     exceeding their **Transportable Moisture Limit** (**TML**)
     - **AMC** - actual moisture content
   - Group **B** – cargoes which possess a chemical hazard which could give rise
     to
     - Materials hazardous only in bulk (**MHB**)
     - Dangerous goods in solid form in bulk
     - Combustible solids
     - Self-heating solids
     - Solids that evolve into flammable gas when wet
     - Solids that evolve toxic gas when wet
     - Toxic solids
     - Corrosive solids
   - Group **C** – cargoes which are neither liable to liquefy (Group A) nor a
     dangerous situation on a ship. possess chemical hazards (Group B). Cargoes
     in this group can still be hazardous.

3. Other hazards associated with carrying solid bulk cargoes

   - Entering enclosed spaces
   - Pesticides (Fumigants)

4. Cargo residues deemed harmful to the marine environment (**HME**)
5. Checklist and flowchart for accepting and loading solid bulk cargoes

- Appendix 1 IMO regulations and guidance relating to the transport of solid
  bulk cargoes

- Appendix 2 The Code section by section
